<!-- Site description -->
A simple website made in Next.js to show my developer portofolio. Check it out: [therealzzy.xyz](https://therealzzy.xyz)

This website is actually a complete full rewrite of my old, hard-to-maintain site: [old site](https://site.therealzzy.xyz) ([repo](https://github.com/then77/old-site))
