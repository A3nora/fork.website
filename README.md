# ⚠️ Why is now outdated?
Every new web design means i need to change a lot things in my website. Because i still want to preserve every website version i created, so i will just archive it while keeping it still publicily. Don't worry, the online version will be still reserved on [v2.therealzzy.xyz](https://v2.therealzzy.xyz) while that means there will be no more updates on the website.
